/*
 *  1. Don't provide "setter" methods â€” 
 *  	methods that modify fields or objects referred to by fields.
 *  2. Make all fields final and private.
 *  3. Don't allow subclasses to override methods. 
 *  	The simplest way to do this is to declare the class as final. 
 *  	A more sophisticated approach is to make the constructor private 
 *  		and construct instances in factory methods.
 *  4. If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, 
 *  	don't allow those objects to be changed:
 *       Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects.
 *       Don't share references to the mutable objects. 
 *       	Never store references to external, mutable objects 
 *       	passed to the constructor; if necessary, create copies, 
 *       	and store references to the copies. Similarly, create copies of 
 *       	your internal mutable objects when necessary to avoid returning 
 *       	the originals in your methods.
